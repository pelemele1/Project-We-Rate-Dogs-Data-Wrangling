    "# Insight Report on We-Rate-Dogs Twitter Archive\n",
    "__by Felix Deichsel, August 23, 2021__\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document we will summarize the insghts we found by analyzing the We-Rate-Dogs Twitter archive. Basically the used data originates from three sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The WeRateDogs Twitter archive, that is downloaded from the udacity server\n",
    "* The tweet image predictions data, which contains the breed of the dog in each tweet according to a neural network\n",
    "* Data, that we get from the Twitter API using Python's Tweepy library\n",
    "\n",
    "After the data acquisition the data was cleaned up, in order to enable a proper analyzing. The final dataset contained following features, that are interesing for us:\n",
    "* Breed: The dog breed of the dog, that is shown in the tweet image\n",
    "* Stage: The dog stage, which can be puppo, pupper, floofer or doggo\n",
    "* Rating: The rating of the dog, that is shown on the tweet image\n",
    "* Retweet count: How often the tweet was retweeted\n",
    "* Favorite Count: How many favourites were given to the tweet\n",
    "* Name: Name of the dog\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on those features we can gain some insights, that are really interesting."

In both diagrams (normal and logarithmic) we can clearly see, the the higher the favorite count, the higher the retweet count is. Also a color shift occurs from the left bottom to top right from some kind of dark green (rating is around 8) to yellow (rating is around 14). Obviously a high rating correlates with a high favorite and retweet count. Nothing else we were expecting. There are also some ratings, that are in the range of 0 to 2. Thats really rude, because as we know, all those dogs are good dogs.\n",
